.TH sacctmgr "1" "Slurm Commands" "August 2022" "Slurm Commands"

.SH "NAME"
sacctmgr \- Used to view and modify Slurm account information.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsacctmgr\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...] [\fICOMMAND\fR...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsacctmgr\fR is used to view or modify Slurm account information.
The account information is maintained within a database with the interface
being provided by \fBslurmdbd\fR (Slurm Database daemon).
This database can serve as a central storehouse of user and
computer information for multiple computers at a single site.
Slurm account information is recorded based upon four parameters
that form what is referred to as an \fIassociation\fR.
These parameters are \fIuser\fR, \fIcluster\fR, \fIpartition\fR, and
\fIaccount\fR. \fIuser\fR is the login name.
\fIcluster\fR is the name of a Slurm managed cluster as specified by
the \fIClusterName\fR parameter in the \fIslurm.conf\fR configuration file.
\fIpartition\fR is the name of a Slurm partition on that cluster.
\fIaccount\fR is the bank account for a job.
The intended mode of operation is to initiate the \fBsacctmgr\fR command,
add, delete, modify, and/or list \fIassociation\fR records then
commit the changes and exit.

\fBNOTE\fR: The contents of Slurm's database are maintained in lower case.
This may result in some \f3sacctmgr\fP output differing from that of other
Slurm commands.

\fBassociation\fR
The entity used to group information consisting of four parameters:
\fBaccount\fR, \fBcluster\fR, \fBpartition\fR (optional), and \fBuser\fR.
Used only with the \fBlist\fR or \fBshow\fR command.  Add, modify, and
delete should be done to a user, account or cluster entity, which will
in turn update the underlying associations. Modification of attributes like
limits is allowed for an association but not a modification of the four
core attributes of an association. You cannot change the partition setting
(or set one if it has not been set) for an existing association. Instead,
you will need to create a new association with the partition included. You
can either keep the previous association with no partition defined, or delete
it. Note that these newly added associations are unique entities and any
existing usage information will not be carried over to the new association.

\fBPreemptMode\fR
Mechanism used to preempt jobs or enable gang scheduling for this QOS
when the cluster \fIPreemptType\fR is set to \fIpreempt/qos\fR.
This QOS\-specific \fBPreemptMode\fR will override the cluster\-wide
\fBPreemptMode\fR for this QOS. Unsetting the QOS specific \fBPreemptMode\fR,
by specifying "OFF", "" or "Cluster", makes it use the default cluster\-wide
\fBPreemptMode\fR.
.br
The \fBGANG\fR option is used to enable gang scheduling independent of
whether preemption is enabled (i.e. independent of the \fBPreemptType\fR
setting). It can be specified in addition to a \fBPreemptMode\fR setting with
the two options comma separated (e.g. \fBPreemptMode=SUSPEND,GANG\fR).
.br
See <https://slurm.schedmd.com/preempt.html> and
<https://slurm.schedmd.com/gang_scheduling.html> for more details.

\fBNOTE:\fR
For performance reasons, the backfill scheduler reserves whole nodes for jobs,
not partial nodes. If during backfill scheduling a job preempts one or more
other jobs, the whole nodes for those preempted jobs are reserved for the
preemptor job, even if the preemptor job requested fewer resources than that.
These reserved nodes aren't available to other jobs during that backfill
cycle, even if the other jobs could fit on the nodes. Therefore, jobs may
preempt more resources during a single backfill iteration than they requested.
.br
\fBNOTE:\fR
For heterogeneous job to be considered for preemption all components
must be eligible for preemption. When a heterogeneous job is to be preempted
the first identified component of the job with the highest order PreemptMode
(\fBSUSPEND\fR (highest), \fBREQUEUE\fR, \fBCANCEL\fR (lowest)) will be
used to set the PreemptMode for all components. The \fBGraceTime\fR and user
warning signal for each component of the heterogeneous job remain unique.
Heterogeneous jobs are excluded from GANG scheduling operations.

\fBGANG\fR
Enables gang scheduling (time slicing) of jobs in the same partition, and
allows the resuming of suspended jobs.
Gang scheduling is performed independently for each partition, so
if you only want time\-slicing by \fBOverSubscribe\fR, without any preemption,
then configuring partitions with overlapping nodes is not recommended.
Time\-slicing won't happen between jobs on different partitions.

\fBNOTE:\fR
Heterogeneous jobs are excluded from GANG scheduling operations.
.IP

.TP
\fBREQUEUE\fR
Preempts jobs by requeuing them (if possible) or canceling them.
For jobs to be requeued they must have the \-\-requeue sbatch option set
or the cluster wide JobRequeue parameter in slurm.conf must be set to \fB1\fR.
.IP

.TP
\fBSUSPEND\fR
The preempted jobs will be suspended, and later the Gang scheduler will resume
them. Therefore the \fBSUSPEND\fR preemption mode always needs the \fBGANG\fR
option to be specified at the cluster level. Also, because the suspended jobs
will still use memory on the allocated nodes, Slurm needs to be able to track
memory resources to be able to suspend jobs.
.br
If \fBPreemptType=preempt/qos\fR is configured and if the preempted job(s) and
the preemptor job are on the same partition, then they will share resources with
the Gang scheduler (time\-slicing). If not (i.e. if the preemptees and preemptor
are on different partitions) then the preempted jobs will remain suspended until
the preemptor ends.

\fBNOTE:\fR Suspended jobs will not release GRES. Higher priority jobs will not
be able to preempt to gain access to GRES.

\fBUsageFactor\fR
A float that is factored into a job’s TRES usage (e.g. RawUsage, TRESMins,
TRESRunMins). For example, if the usagefactor was 2, for every TRESBillingUnit
second a job ran it would count for 2. If the usagefactor was .5, every second
would only count for half of the time. A setting of 0 would add no timed usage
from the job.

The usage factor only applies to the job's QOS and not the partition QOS.

If the \fIUsageFactorSafe\fR flag \fIis\fR set and
\fIAccountingStorageEnforce\fR includes \fISafe\fR, jobs will only be
able to run if the job can run to completion with the \fIUsageFactor\fR
applied.

If the \fIUsageFactorSafe\fR flag is \fInot\fR set and
\fIAccountingStorageEnforce\fR includes \fISafe\fR, a job will be able to
be scheduled without the \fIUsageFactor\fR applied and will be able to run
without being killed due to limits.

If the \fIUsageFactorSafe\fR flag is \fInot\fR set and
\fIAccountingStorageEnforce\fR does not include \fISafe\fR, a job will be
able to be scheduled without the \fIUsageFactor\fR applied and could be killed
due to limits.

See \fIAccountingStorageEnforce\fR in slurm.conf man page.

Default is 1. To clear a previously set value use the modify command with a new

.SH "TRES information"
Trackable RESources (TRES) are used in many QOS or Association limits.
When setting the limits they are comma separated list.  Each TRES has
a different limit, i.e. GrpTRESMins=cpu=10,mem=20 would make 2
different limits 1 for 10 cpu minutes and 1 for 20 MB memory minutes.
This is the case for each limit that deals with TRES.  To remove the
limit \-1 is used i.e. GrpTRESMins=cpu=\-1 would remove only the cpu
TRES limit.

NOTE: When dealing with Memory as a TRES all limits are in MB.

NOTE: The Billing TRES is calculated from a partition's TRESBillingWeights. It
is temporarily calculated during scheduling for each partition to enforce
billing TRES limits. The final Billing TRES is calculated after the job has been
allocated resources. The final number can be seen in \fBscontrol show jobs\fP
and \fBsacct\fP output.

.SH "GLOBAL FORMAT OPTION"
When using the format option for listing various fields you can put a

e.g. format=name%30 will print 30 characters of field name right
justified.  A \-30 will print 30 characters left justified.

.SH "FLAT FILE DUMP AND LOAD"
sacctmgr has the capability to load and dump Slurm association data to and
from a file.  This method can easily add a new cluster or copy an
existing cluster's associations into a new cluster with similar
accounts. Each file contains Slurm association data for a single
cluster. Be aware that QOS information is not currently included in the
information that can be dumped to a file. QOS information can be retrieved
and loaded using the REST API or it must be transferred to a new cluster
manually. Comments can be put into the file with the # character.
Each line of information must begin with one of the four titles; \fBCluster\fP,
\fBParent\fP, \fBAccount\fP or \fBUser\fP. Following the title is a space,
dash, space, entity value, then specifications. Specifications are colon
separated. If any variable, such as an Organization name, has a space in it,
surround the name with single or double quotes.

To create a file of associations you can run
.RS
\fBsacctmgr dump tux file=tux.cfg\fP
.RE

To load a previously created file you can run
.RS
\fBsacctmgr load file=tux.cfg\fP
.RE

sacctmgr dump/load must be run as a Slurm administrator or root. If using
sacctmgr load on a database without any associations, it must be run as root
(because there aren't any users in the database yet).

Other options for load are:
.RS
\fBclean\fP     \- delete what was already there and start from scratch with
this information.
.br
\fBCluster=\fP  \- specify a different name for the cluster than that which is
in the file.
.RE

Since the associations in the system follow a hierarchy, so does the
file.  Anything that is a parent needs to be defined before any
children.  The only exception is the understood 'root' account.  This
is always a default for any cluster and does not need to be defined.

To edit/create a file start with a cluster line for the new cluster:

.nf
\fBCluster\ \-\ cluster_name:MaxTRESPerJob=node=15\fP
.fi

Anything included on this line will be the default for all
associations on this cluster.  The options for the cluster are:

.SH "ARCHIVE FUNCTIONALITY"
Sacctmgr has the capability to archive to a flatfile and or load that
data if needed later.  The archiving is usually done by the slurmdbd
and it is highly recommended you only do it through sacctmgr if you
completely understand what you are doing.  For slurmdbd options see
"man slurmdbd" for more information.
Loading data into the database can be done from these files to either
view old data or regenerate rolled up data.

.SS archive dump
Dump accounting data to file. Data will not be archived unless the
corresponding purge option is included in this command or in slurmdbd.conf.
This operation cannot be rolled back
once executed. If one of the following options is not specified when sacctmgr
is called, the value configured in slurmdbd.conf is used.

.TP
\fBDirectory=\fR
Directory to store the archive data.
.IP

.TP
\fBEvents\fR
Archive Events.  If not specified and PurgeEventAfter is set
all event data removed will be lost permanently.
.IP

.TP
\fBJobs\fR
Archive Jobs.  If not specified and PurgeJobAfter is set
all job data removed will be lost permanently.
.IP

.TP
\fBPurgeEventAfter=\fR
Purge cluster event records older than time stated in months.  If you
want to purge on a shorter time period you can include hours, or days
behind the numeric value to get those more frequent purges. (e.g. a
value of '12hours' would purge everything older than 12 hours.)
.IP

.TP
\fBPurgeJobAfter=\fR
Purge job records older than time stated in months.  If you
want to purge on a shorter time period you can include hours, or days
behind the numeric value to get those more frequent purges. (e.g. a
value of '12hours' would purge everything older than 12 hours.)
.IP

.TP
\fBPurgeStepAfter=\fR
Purge step records older than time stated in months.  If you
want to purge on a shorter time period you can include hours, or days
behind the numeric value to get those more frequent purges. (e.g. a
value of '12hours' would purge everything older than 12 hours.)
.IP

.TP
\fBPurgeSuspendAfter=\fR
Purge job suspend records older than time stated in months.  If you
want to purge on a shorter time period you can include hours, or days
behind the numeric value to get those more frequent purges. (e.g. a
value of '12hours' would purge everything older than 12 hours.)
.IP

.TP
\fBScript=\fR
Run this script instead of the generic form of archive to flat files.
.IP

.TP
\fBSteps\fR
Archive Steps.  If not specified and PurgeStepAfter is set
all step data removed will be lost permanently.
.IP

.TP
\fBSuspend\fR
Archive Suspend Data.  If not specified and PurgeSuspendAfter is set
all suspend data removed will be lost permanently.

.SS archive load
Load in to the database previously archived data. The archive file will not be
loaded if the records already exist in the database \- therefore, trying to load
an archive file more than once will result in an error. When this data is again
archived and purged from the database, if the old archive file is still in the
directory ArchiveDir, a new archive file will be created (see ArchiveDir in the
slurmdbd.conf man page), so the old file will not be overwritten and these files
will have duplicate records.

.P
Archive files from the current or any prior Slurm release may be loaded
through \fBarchive load\fR.

.TP
\fBFile=\fR
File to load into database. The specified file must exist on the slurmdbd host,
which is not necessarily the machine running the command.
.IP

.TP
\fBInsert=\fR
SQL to insert directly into the database.  This should be used very
cautiously since this is writing your sql into the database.
.IP

.SH "PERFORMANCE"
.PP
Executing \fBsacctmgr\fR sends a remote procedure call to \fBslurmdbd\fR. If
enough calls from \fBsacctmgr\fR or other Slurm client commands that send remote
procedure calls to the \fBslurmdbd\fR daemon come in at once, it can result in a
degradation of performance of the \fBslurmdbd\fR daemon, possibly resulting in a
denial of service.
.PP
Do not run \fBsacctmgr\fR or other Slurm client commands that send remote
procedure calls to \fBslurmdbd\fR from loops in shell scripts or other programs.
Ensure that programs limit calls to \fBsacctmgr\fR to the minimum necessary for
the information you are trying to gather.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
Some \fBsacctmgr\fR options may be set via environment variables. These
environment variables, along with their corresponding options, are listed below.
(Note: Command line options will always override these settings.)

.TP 20
\fBSLURM_CONF\fR
The location of the Slurm configuration file.
.IP

.TP
\fBSLURM_DEBUG_FLAGS\fR
Specify debug flags for sacctmgr to use. See DebugFlags in the
\fBslurm.conf\fR(5) man page for a full list of flags. The environment
variable takes precedence over the setting in the slurm.conf.
.IP

.SH "SACCTMGR_EXTEND"
.PP
The import format for the SACCTMGR_EXTEND environment variable is as follows:
export SACCTMGR_EXTEND=field:[.][-]number,field:[.][-]number.'.' represents the print format, 
where '.' indicates left indentation and no '.' indicates right indentation.
The '-' sign after the colon represents left alignment.
The number represents the length of the print format. 
.PP
The supported fields for left and right indentation are as follows, 
Account, Action, Actor, Admin, Assocs, TRES, Class, Cluster, Cluster, Coord Accounts, ControlHost, CPU Cnt, 
Def Acct, Def QOS, Def WCKey, Descr, Event, Features, Federation, FedState, Flags, GrpTRES, GrpTRESMins, GrpTRESRunMins,

Type, User, WCKeys, Where.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
\fBNOTE:\fR There is an order to set up accounting associations.
You must define clusters before you add accounts and you must add accounts
before you can add users.

.nf
$ sacctmgr create cluster tux
$ sacctmgr create account name=science fairshare=50
$ sacctmgr create account name=chemistry parent=science fairshare=30
$ sacctmgr create account name=physics parent=science fairshare=20
$ sacctmgr create user name=adam cluster=tux account=physics fairshare=10
$ sacctmgr delete user name=adam cluster=tux account=physics
$ sacctmgr delete account name=physics cluster=tux
$ sacctmgr modify user where name=adam cluster=tux account=physics set maxjobs=2 maxwall=30:00
$ sacctmgr add user brian account=chemistry
$ sacctmgr list associations cluster=tux format=Account,Cluster,User,Fairshare tree withd
$ sacctmgr list transactions Action="Add Users" Start=11/03\-10:30:00 format=Where,Time
$ sacctmgr dump cluster=tux file=tux_data_file
$ sacctmgr load tux_data_file
.fi

A user's account can not be changed directly. A new association needs to be
created for the user with the new account. Then the association with the old
account can be deleted.

When modifying an object placing the key words 'set' and the
optional 'where' is critical to perform correctly below are examples to
produce correct results.  As a rule of thumb anything you put in front
of the set will be used as a quantifier.  If you want to put a
quantifier after the key word 'set' you should use the key
word 'where'. The following is wrong:

.nf
$ sacctmgr modify user name=adam set fairshare=10 cluster=tux
.fi

This will produce an error as the above line reads modify user adam
set fairshare=10 and cluster=tux. Either of the following is correct:

.nf
$ sacctmgr modify user name=adam cluster=tux set fairshare=10
$ sacctmgr modify user name=adam set fairshare=10 where cluster=tux
.fi

When changing qos for something only use the '=' operator when wanting
to explicitly set the qos to something.  In most cases you will want
to use the '+=' or '\-=' operator to either add to or remove from the
existing qos already in place.

If a user already has qos of normal,standby for a parent or it was
explicitly set you should use qos+=expedite to add this to the list in
this fashion.

If you are looking to only add the qos expedite to only a certain
account and or cluster you can do that by specifying them in the
sacctmgr line.

.nf
$ sacctmgr modify user name=adam set qos+=expedite
.fi

or

.nf
$ sacctmgr modify user name=adam acct=this cluster=tux set qos+=expedite
.fi

Let's give an example how to add QOS to user accounts.
List all available QOSs in the cluster.

.nf
$ sacctmgr show qos format=name
      Name
  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
    normal
  expedite
.fi

List all the associations in the cluster.

.nf
$ sacctmgr show assoc format=cluster,account,qos
   Cluster    Account    QOS
  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- \-\-\-\-\-
  zebra       root         normal
  zebra       root         normal
  zebra          g         normal
  zebra         g1         normal
.fi

Add the QOS expedite to account G1 and display the result.
Using the operator += the QOS will be added together
with the  existing QOS to this account.

.nf
$ sacctmgr modify account name=g1 set qos+=expedite
$ sacctmgr show assoc format=cluster,account,qos
   Cluster    Account   QOS
   \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-
   zebra       root         normal
   zebra       root         normal
   zebra          g         normal
   zebra         g1  expedite,normal
.fi

Now set the QOS expedite as the only QOS for the account G and display
the result. Using the operator = that expedite is the only usable
QOS by account G

.nf
$ sacctmgr modify account name=G set qos=expedite
$ sacctmgr show assoc format=cluster,account,user,qos
   Cluster    Account  QOS
  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-   \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- \-\-\-\-\-
  zebra       root      normal
  zebra       root      normal
  zebra          g      expedite
  zebra         g1      expedite,normal
.fi

If a new account is added under the account G it will inherit the
QOS expedite and it will not have access to QOS normal.

.nf
$ sacctmgr add account banana parent=G
$ sacctmgr show assoc format=cluster,account,qos
   Cluster    Account   QOS
  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-  \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-  \-\-\-\-\-
  zebra       root       normal
  zebra       root       normal
  zebra          g       expedite
  zebra     banana       expedite
  zebra         g1       expedite,normal
.fi

An example of listing trackable resources:

.nf
$ sacctmgr show tres
      Type              Name      ID
\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\- \-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-
       cpu                          1
       mem                          2
    energy                          3
      node                          4
   billing                          5
