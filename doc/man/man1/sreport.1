.TH sreport "1" "Slurm Commands" "October 2022" "Slurm Commands"

.SH "NAME"
sreport \- Generate reports from the slurm accounting data.

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBsreport\fR [\fIOPTIONS\fR...] [\fICOMMAND\fR...]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBsreport\fR is used to generate reports of job usage and cluster
utilization for Slurm jobs saved to the Slurm Database,
\fBslurmdbd\fR.

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-all_clusters\fR
Use all clusters instead of only the cluster from which the command was
executed.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-M\fR, \fB\-\-cluster\fR
The cluster(s) to generate reports for. Default is local cluster, unless the
local cluster is currently part of a federation and in that case generate a
report for all clusters in the current federation. If the clusters included
in a federation vary through time, use this option to identify the clusters
to be included in report. Implies \-\-local.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-federation\fR
Generate a report for the federation if a member of one.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Print a help message describing the usage of \fBsreport\fR.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-\-local\fR
Generate a report for the local cluster, even if part of a federation.
Overrides \fB\-\-federation\fR.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-noheader\fR
Don't display header when listing results.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-parsable\fR
Output will be '|' delimited with a '|' at the end.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-parsable2\fR
Output will be '|' delimited without a '|' at the end.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-Q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Print no warning or informational messages, only error messages.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-t\fR <\fItime_format\fR>
Specify the output time format. Time format options are case
insensitive and may be abbreviated. The default format is Minutes.
Supported time format options are listed in the \fBtime\fP command
section below.
.IP

.TP
\fB\-T\fR, \fB\-\-tres\fR=<\fItres_names\fR>
Trackable resource (TRES) to report values for.
By default CPU resource use is reported (except for reservation reports. All
TRES types reserved by a reservation will be shown by default unless overridden
with this option).
Multiple TRES names may be separated using a comma separated list for all
reports except the job reports, which can only support a single TRES name, or
"ALL" for all TRES.

The "Reported" Billing TRES is calculated from the largest Billing TRES of each
node multiplied by the time frame. For example, if a node is part of multiple
partitions and each has a different TRESBillingWeights defined the Billing TRES
for the node will be the highest of the partitions.  If TRESBillingWeights is
not defined on any partition for a node then the Billing TRES will be equal to
the number of CPUs on the node.

TRES node usage is no longer reported in percent format or in Cluster
Utilization.  Please use TRES CPU instead.
The main issue with using node is in most configurations multiple jobs are able
to run on the same node.  This makes TRES node accounting count the same node
multiple times in the same period.  In exclusive node configurations, CPU
accounting returns the same usage node accounting would.

\fBNOTE\fR: If \fBOverSubscribe\fR is configured to \fBFORCE\fR or \fBYES\fR
in your slurm.conf and the system is not configured to use preemption
(\fBPreemptMode=OFF\fR) accounting can easily grow to values greater than
the actual utilization. It may be common on such systems to get error messages
in the slurmdbd log stating: "We have more allocated time than is possible."

.SH "REPORT DESCRIPTION"

.TP
.B cluster AccountUtilizationByUser
This report will display account utilization as it appears on the
hierarchical tree.  Starting with the specified account or the
root account by default this report will list the underlying
usage with a sum on each level.  Use the 'tree' option to span
the tree for better visibility.

\fBNOTE\fR: Idle reservation time will be split evenly among accounts/users
given access to it. When a reservation is assigned to whole accounts, the
time will be counted in the association for the accounts, not the user
associations in the accounts. In this case, the usage of a parent account can
be larger than the sum of its children.
.IP

.TP
.B cluster UserUtilizationByAccount
This report will display users by account in order of utilization without
grouping multiple accounts by user into one, but displaying them
on separate lines.
.IP

.TP
.B cluster UserUtilizationByWCKey
This report will display users by wckey in order of utilization without
grouping multiple wckey by user into one, but displaying them
on separate lines.
.IP

.TP
.B cluster Utilization
This report will display total usage divided amongst Allocated, Down,
Planned Down, Idle, and Planned time for selected clusters.
.RS
.IP Allocated 14

Time that nodes were in use with active jobs or an active reservation.
This does not include reservations created with the MAINT or IGNORE_JOBS
flags.
.IP Down

Time that nodes were marked as Down or fully Drained, or time that slurmctld was
not responding (assuming TrackSlurmctldDown is set in slurmdbd.conf).
.IP Idle

Time that nodes were not Allocated, Down, PlannedDown, or Planned.
.IP OverCommitted

Time of eligible jobs waiting in the queue over the Planned time. Unlike
Planned, this has no limit. It is typically useful to determine whether your
system is overloaded and by how much.
.IP PlannedDown

Time that nodes were in use by a reservation created with the MAINT flag
but not the IGNORE_JOBS flag. Also, time that nodes were in the FUTURE state or
CLOUD nodes that were POWERED_DOWN.
.IP Planned

Time that nodes were not Allocated, Down or PlannedDown with eligible jobs in
the queue that were unable to start due to time or size constraints. The maximum
time is limited to the amount of time possible on the system. If this value is
not of importance for you then the number can be grouped with idle time.
.IP TresCount

Configured number of TRES' on the reported nodes. See also the
\fBTresName\fP field.
.RE
.RS 7

Note: Reservations created with the IGNORE_JOBS flag are not tracked
in the Cluster Utilization report due to the fact that allowing any
current/active jobs to continue to run in the reservation introduces the
possibility for them to be accounted for incorrectly.
The jobs in these reservations will be tracked as normal rather than
being bundled in the reservation time, as they are with reservations that
do not have the IGNORE_JOBS flag.
.RE
.RS

Note: The default view for the "Cluster Utilization" report includes the
following fields: Cluster, Allocated, Down, PlannedDown, Idle, Planned,
Reported. You can include additional fields like OverCommitted and TresCount
fields with the \fBFormat\fP option. The TresName will also be included if
using the \fB\-T,  \-\-tres <tres_names>\fR option.

.IP

.TP
.B cluster WCKeyUtilizationByUser
This report will display wckey utilization sorted by WCKey name for
each user on each cluster.
.IP

.TP
.B job SizesByAccount
This report will display the amount of time used for job ranges
specified by the 'grouping=' option.  Only a single level in the tree
is displayed defaulting to the root dir.  If you specify other
accounts with the 'account=' option sreport will use those accounts as
the root account and you will receive the aggregated totals of each listed
account plus their sub accounts.
.IP

.TP
.B job SizesByAccountAndWckey
This report is very similar to SizesByAccount with the difference being
each account is pair with wckeys so the identifier is account:wckey
instead of just account so there will most likely be multiple accounts
listed depending on the number of wckeys used.
.IP

.TP
.B job SizesByWckey
This report will display the amount of time for each wckey for job ranges
specified by the 'grouping=' option.
.IP

.TP
.B reservation Utilization
This report will display total usage for reservations on the systems.
Note: Time requests on this report will not truncate the time the reservation
used, only the reservations that ran at any time during the period requested.
.IP

.TP
.B user TopUsage
Displays the top users on a cluster, i.e. users with the highest usage.
By default users are sorted by CPUTime, but the \-T, \-\-tres option will
sort users by the first TRES specified.

Use the group option to group accounts together.
The default is to have a different line for each user account combination.

.SH "PERFORMANCE"
.PP
Executing \fBsreport\fR sends a remote procedure call to \fBslurmdbd\fR. If
enough calls from \fBsreport\fR or other Slurm client commands that send remote
procedure calls to the \fBslurmdbd\fR daemon come in at once, it can result in a
degradation of performance of the \fBslurmdbd\fR daemon, possibly resulting in a
denial of service.
.PP
Do not run \fBsreport\fR or other Slurm client commands that send remote
procedure calls to \fBslurmdbd\fR from loops in shell scripts or other programs.
Ensure that programs limit calls to \fBsreport\fR to the minimum necessary for
the information you are trying to gather.

.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.PP
Some \fBsreport\fR options may be set via environment variables. These
